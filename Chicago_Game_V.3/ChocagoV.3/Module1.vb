    REM variables required so far:
    REM Round (this is to keep count of the rounds and end the loop when they 
    REM have reached the 12th round (11th round))
    REM Die number as new random (this will give the players a random number between 1 
    REM and 6 so its parameters are 1, 7)
    REM Human die 1 as integer (this will be player ones first throw on each round, 
    REM this will be a random number)
    REM Human die 2 as integer (this will be player ones second throw on each round, 
    REM this will also be a random number)
    REM Human dice total as integer (this will add both human die one and human die 2 to give the 
    REM total that will be compared to the rounds number)
    REM Player 1 score as integer (this will be player ones total score after each round and 
    REM will be used to determine the winner)
    REM Computer die 1 as integer (this will be player twos first throw on each round, 
    REM this will be a random number)
    REM Computer die 2 as integer (this will be player twos second throw on each round, 
    REM this will also be a random number) 
    REM Computer dice total as integer (this will add both computer die one and computer die 2 
    REM to give the total that will be compared to the rounds number) 
    REM Player 2 score as integer (this will be player ones total score after each round and 
    REM will be used to determine the winner)
