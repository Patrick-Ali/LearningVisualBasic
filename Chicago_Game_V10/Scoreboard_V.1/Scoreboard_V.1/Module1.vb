    REM This structure is to create the Arrays for the player

    REM This is the players arrays set as the structure I have made
    Dim players(10) As player

    REM the variable to loop the username verification (loop1)
    Dim TextFileNum, x, loop1 As Integer
    REM The PlayerUserName variable is to record what the player types as there username and compare it to the usernames in the array
    REM The PlayerPassword variable is to record what the player types as there password and compare it to the password in the array
    REM The PlayerPassword variable is used after the username verification test
    Dim PlayerUserName, PlayerPassword As String
    REM The Die variable is used to create the number on the die roll and is set to random so as to generate a random number between a 
    REM Given parameter in this case 1-7 as you give one above the highest number you want so as to generate the highest number you want 
    Dim Die As New Random
    REM HumanDieRoll1 is used to generate the first die roll for the human for that round 
    REM HumanDieRoll2 is used to generate the second die roll for the human for that round 
    REM HumanDieTotal is used to generate the total score for the human for that round
    REM ComputerDie1 is used to generate the first die roll for the computer for that round 
    REM ComputerDie2 is used to generate the second die roll for the computer for that round 
    REM ComputerDieTotal is used to generate the total score for the Computer for that round
    REM "A" will be used as the name of the variable for the loop which will be used for the main game 
    REM Round will be used to tell the player what round it is in Chicago Game terms as round 1 is round 2 in Chicago Game terms
    REM HumanScore will be the combined total of all points scored by the human (player) during a game 
    Dim HumanDieRoll1, HumanDieRoll2, HumanDieTotal, ComputerDie1, ComputerDie2, ComputerDieTotal, A, Round, HumanScore As Integer
    REM ComputerScore will be the combined total of all points scored by the computer (opponent) during a game

    REM player records when the player is finished with the game 
    Dim ComputerScore, Position As Integer
    REM This variable will be used to navigate the various options in the game such as if the player selects option one the if statement used
